# Automated Text Messaging Script

## Usage

1. Edit fields (see below)
2. Note: Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system before running the script.
3. Open a terminal.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
5. Run the script using the following command:

``` python3 send-texts.py ```

WARNING: I would recommend testing this a few times to get the hang of how it works.

## Editing Fields

1. Numbers: Add the phone numbers you want to send messages to. Format them without dashes and parentheses, separated by commas. 

Example:
``` numbers = [1234567890, 9876543210, ...] ```

2. Message: Replace "ADD YOUR MESSAGE HERE" with your desired message.

Note: currently there is no functionality for sending images.
